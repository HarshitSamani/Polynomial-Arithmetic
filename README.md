## About The Project

This code performs addition and multiplication of bivariate polynomials represented in memory with doubly linked lists. The entire program is written in C-language. Comments have been added frequently to help in understanding the logic behind implementation. The two polynomials have to inputted as (power_x,power_y,coefficient) tuples. This program performs the addition and multiplication of the first polynomial with the second and outputs the result in (power_x,power_y,coefficient) tuple. This program repeats indefinitely till exited manually.
